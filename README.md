# ESP32 Client C sharp server Simple chat
 
Server written in C#, using delegates for each client connection into its own function.
Client is using the Arduino IDE, connecting to WIFI using SSID and PASSWORD, and then to server.
Server and Client can chat with each other, and if server sends "on", or "off", then the led at the ESP will trigger.

This repo created simple as possible for students to use this code for their projects.

**If you dont have Visual studio or cant compile the code you can use the release i uploaded:**
